### Attribute Inheritance​
A "fallthrough attribute" is an attribute or `v-on` event listener that is passed to a component, but is not explicitly declared in the receiving component's props or emits. Common examples of this include `class`, `style`, and `id` attributes.

When a component renders a single root element, fallthrough attributes will be automatically added to the root element's attributes. For example, given a `<MyButton>` component with the following template:

```
<!-- template of <MyButton> -->
<button>Click Me</button>
```

And a parent using this component with:

```
<MyButton class="large" />
```

The final rendered DOM would be:

```
<button class="large">Click Me</button>
```

Here, `<MyButton>` did not declare `class` as an accepted prop. Therefore, class is treated as a fallthrough attribute and automatically added to `<MyButton>`'s root element.

### `class` and `style` Merging​
If the child component's root element already has existing class or style attributes, it will be merged with the `class` and `style` values that are inherited from the parent. Suppose we change the template of `<MyButton>` in the previous example to:

```
<!-- template of <MyButton> -->
<button class="btn">Click Me</button>
```

Then the final rendered DOM would now become:

```
<button class="btn large">Click Me</button>
```

### `v-on` Listener Inheritance​
The same rule applies to v-on event listeners:

```
<MyButton @click="onClick" />
```

The `click` listener will be added to the root element of `<MyButton>`, i.e. the native `<button>` element. When the native `<button>` is clicked, it will trigger the `onClick` method of the parent component. If the native `<button>` already has a `click` listener bound with `v-on`, then both listeners will trigger.

### Nested Component Inheritance​
If a component renders another component as its root node, for example, we refactored `<MyButton>` to render a `<BaseButton>` as its root:

```
<!-- template of <MyButton/> that simply renders another component -->
<BaseButton />
```

Then the fallthrough attributes received by `<MyButton>` will be automatically forwarded to `<BaseButton>`.

Note that:

1 Forwarded attributes do not include any attributes that are declared as props, or `v-on` listeners of declared events by `<MyButton>` - in other words, the declared props and listeners have been "consumed" by `<MyButton>`.

2 Forwarded attributes may be accepted as props by `<BaseButton>`, if declared by it.
