### Introduction​
In addition to the default set of directives shipped in core (like `v-model` or `v-show`), Vue also allows you to register your own custom directives.

We have introduced two forms of code reuse in Vue: components and [composables](reuseable/composables). Components are the main building blocks, while composables are focused on reusing stateful logic. Custom directives, on the other hand, are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.

A custom directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component. The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to. Here is an example of a directive that adds a class to an element when it is inserted into the DOM by Vue:

```
<script setup>
// enables v-highlight in templates
const vHighlight = {
  mounted: (el) => {
    el.classList.add('is-highlight')
  }
}
</script>

<template>
  <p v-highlight>This sentence is important!</p>
</template>
```

In `<script setup>`, any camelCase variable that starts with the v prefix can be used as a custom directive. In the example above, `vHighlight` can be used in the template as `v-highlight`.

If you are not using `<script setup>`, custom directives can be registered using the directives option:

```
export default {
  setup() {
    /*...*/
  },
  directives: {
    // enables v-highlight in template
    highlight: {
      /* ... */
    }
  }
}
```

It is also common to globally register custom directives at the app level:

```
const app = createApp({})

// make v-highlight usable in all components
app.directive('highlight', {
  /* ... */
})
```

### When to use custom directives​
Custom directives should only be used when the desired functionality can only be achieved via direct DOM manipulation.

A common example of this is a `v-focus` custom directive that brings an element into focus.

```
<script setup>
// enables v-focus in templates
const vFocus = {
  mounted: (el) => el.focus()
}
</script>

<template>
  <input v-focus />
</template>s
```

This directive is more useful than the `autofocus` attribute because it works not just on page load - it also works when the element is dynamically inserted by Vue!

Declarative templating with built-in directives such as `v-bind` is recommended when possible because they are more efficient and server-rendering friendly.
