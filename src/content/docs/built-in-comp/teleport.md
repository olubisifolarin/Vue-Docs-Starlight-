`<Teleport>` is a built-in component that allows us to "teleport" a part of a component's template into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of that component.

### Basic Usage​
Sometimes a part of a component's template belongs to it logically, but from a visual standpoint, it should be displayed somewhere else in the DOM, perhaps even outside of the Vue application.

The most common example of this is when building a full-screen modal. Ideally, we want the code for the modal's button and the modal itself to be written within the same single-file component, since they are both related to the open / close state of the modal. But that means the modal will be rendered alongside the button, deeply nested in the application's DOM hierarchy. This can create some tricky issues when positioning the modal via CSS.

Consider the following HTML structure.

```
<div class="outer">
  <h3>Vue Teleport Example</h3>
  <div>
    <MyModal />
  </div>
</div>
```
And here is the implementation of `<MyModal>`:

```
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const open = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="open = true">Open Modal</button>

  <div v-if="open" class="modal">
    <p>Hello from the modal!</p>
    <button @click="open = false">Close</button>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.modal {
  position: fixed;
  z-index: 999;
  top: 20%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 300px;
  margin-left: -150px;
}
</style>
```

The component contains a `<button>` to trigger the opening of the modal, and a `<div>` with a class of `.modal`, which will contain the modal's content and a button to self-close.

When using this component inside the initial HTML structure, there are a number of potential issues:

- position: fixed only places the element relative to the viewport when no ancestor element has `transform`, `perspective` or `filter` property set. If, for example, we intend to animate the ancestor `<div class="outer">` with a CSS transform, it would break the modal layout!

- The modal's `z-index` is constrained by its containing elements. If there is another element that overlaps with `<div` class="outer"> and has a higher z-index, it would cover our modal.

`<Teleport>` provides a clean way to work around these, by allowing us to break out of the nested DOM structure. Let's modify `<MyModal>` to use `<Teleport>`:

```
<button @click="open = true">Open Modal</button>

<Teleport to="body">
  <div v-if="open" class="modal">
    <p>Hello from the modal!</p>
    <button @click="open = false">Close</button>
  </div>
</Teleport>
```

:::tip[TIP]
The teleport to target must be already in the DOM when the `<Teleport>` component is mounted. Ideally, this should be an element outside the entire Vue application. If targeting another element rendered by Vue, you need to make sure that element is mounted before the `<Teleport>`.
