:::danger[Experimental Feature]
`<Suspense>` is an experimental feature. It is not guaranteed to reach stable status and the API may change before it does.

`<Suspense>` is a built-in component for orchestrating async dependencies in a component tree. It can render a loading state while waiting for multiple nested async dependencies down the component tree to be resolved.
