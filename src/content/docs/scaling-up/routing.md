### Client-Side vs. Server-Side Routingâ€‹
Routing on the server side means the server is sending a response based on the URL path that the user is visiting. When we click on a link in a traditional server-rendered web app, the browser receives an HTML response from the server and reloads the entire page with the new HTML.

In a [Single-Page Application (SPA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA), however, the client-side JavaScript can intercept the navigation, dynamically fetch new data, and update the current page without full page reloads. This typically results in a more snappy user experience, especially for use cases that are more like actual "applications", where the user is expected to perform many interactions over a long period of time.

In such SPAs, the "routing" is done on the client side, in the browser. A client-side router is responsible for managing the application's rendered view using browser APIs such as [History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History) or the `hashchange` event.
