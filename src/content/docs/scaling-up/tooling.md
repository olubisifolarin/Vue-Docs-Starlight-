### Try It Online​
You don't need to install anything on your machine to try out Vue SFCs - there are online playgrounds that allow you to do so right in the browser:

- <a href="https://play.vuejs.org/" target="_blank" style="display: inline-flex; align-items: center; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bolder; color: blue;">
  ▶️ Vue SFC Playground.
</a>

    - Always deployed from latest commit
    - Designed for inspecting component compilation results


- [Vue + Vite on StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-pxsnfk7c?file=index.html&terminal=dev)
    - IDE-like environment running actual Vite dev server in the browser
    - Closest to local setup
It is also recommended to use these online playgrounds to provide reproductions when reporting bugs.
