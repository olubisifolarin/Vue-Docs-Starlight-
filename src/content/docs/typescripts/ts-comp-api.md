### Typing Component Props​
#### Using `<script setup>​`
When using `<script setup>`, the `defineProps()` macro supports inferring the props types based on its argument:

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps({
  foo: { type: String, required: true },
  bar: Number
})

props.foo // string
props.bar // number | undefined
</script>
```

This is called "runtime declaration", because the argument passed to `defineProps()` will be used as the runtime `props` option.

However, it is usually more straightforward to define props with pure types via a generic type argument:

```
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps<{
  foo: string
  bar?: number
}>()
</script>
```

This is called "type-based declaration". The compiler will try to do its best to infer the equivalent runtime options based on the type argument. In this case, our second example compiles into the exact same runtime options as the first example.

You can use either type-based declaration OR runtime declaration, but you cannot use both at the same time.

We can also move the props types into a separate interface:

```
<script setup lang="ts">
interface Props {
  foo: string
  bar?: number
}

const props = defineProps<Props>()
</script>
```

This also works if `Props` is imported from an external source. This feature requires TypeScript to be a peer dependency of Vue.

```
<script setup lang="ts">
import type { Props } from './foo'

const props = defineProps<Props>()
</script>
```
##### Syntax Limitations​
In version 3.2 and below, the generic type parameter for `defineProps()` were limited to a type literal or a reference to a local interface.

This limitation has been resolved in 3.3. The latest version of Vue supports referencing imported and a limited set of complex types in the type parameter position. However, because the type to runtime conversion is still AST-based, some complex types that require actual type analysis, e.g. conditional types, are not supported. You can use conditional types for the type of a single prop, but not the entire props object.

#### Props Default Values​
When using type-based declaration, we lose the ability to declare default values for the props. This can be resolved by using Reactive Props Destructure :

```
interface Props {
  msg?: string
  labels?: string[]
}

const { msg = 'hello', labels = ['one', 'two'] } = defineProps<Props>()
```

In 3.4 and below, Reactive Props Destructure is not enabled by default. An alternative is to use the `withDefaults` compiler macro:

```
interface Props {
  msg?: string
  labels?: string[]
}

const props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {
  msg: 'hello',
  labels: () => ['one', 'two']
})
```

This will be compiled to equivalent runtime props `default` options. In addition, the `withDefaults` helper provides type checks for the default values, and ensures the returned `props` type has the optional flags removed for properties that do have default values declared.

:::info[INFO]
Note that default values for mutable reference types (like arrays or objects) should be wrapped in functions when using `withDefaults` to avoid accidental modification and external side effects. This ensures each component instance gets its own copy of the default value. This is not necessary when using default values with destructure.
