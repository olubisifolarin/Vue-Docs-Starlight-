title: Using Vue with TypeScript
description:

A type system like TypeScript can detect many common errors via static analysis at build time. This reduces the chance of runtime errors in production, and also allows us to more confidently refactor code in large-scale applications. TypeScript also improves developer ergonomics via type-based auto-completion in IDEs.

Vue is written in TypeScript itself and provides first-class TypeScript support. All official Vue packages come with bundled type declarations that should work out-of-the-box.

### Project Setup​
'create-vue', the official project scaffolding tool, offers the options to scaffold a [Vite](https://vite.dev/)-powered, TypeScript-ready Vue project.

#### Overview​
With a Vite-based setup, the dev server and the bundler are transpilation-only and do not perform any type-checking. This ensures the Vite dev server stays blazing fast even when using TypeScript.

- During development, we recommend relying on a good IDE setup for instant feedback on type errors.

- If using SFCs, use the `vue-tsc` utility for command line type checking and type declaration generation. `vue-tsc` is a wrapper around `tsc`, TypeScript's own command line interface. It works largely the same as `tsc` except that it supports Vue SFCs in addition to TypeScript files. You can run `vue-tsc` in watch mode in parallel to the Vite dev server, or use a Vite plugin like [vite-plugin-checker](https://vite-plugin-checker.netlify.app/) which runs the checks in a separate worker thread.

- Vue CLI also provides TypeScript support, but is no longer recommended. See notes below.

#### IDE Support​
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) is strongly recommended for its great out-of-the-box support for TypeScript.

[Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (previously Volar) is the official VS Code extension that provides TypeScript support inside Vue SFCs, along with many other great features.

Vue - Official extension replaces [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur), our previous official VS Code extension for Vue 2. If you have Vetur currently installed, make sure to disable it in Vue 3 projects.

[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) also provides out-of-the-box support for both TypeScript and Vue. Other JetBrains IDEs support them too, either out of the box or [via a free plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9442-vue-js). As of version 2023.2, WebStorm and the Vue Plugin come with built-in support for the Vue Language Server. You can set the Vue service to use Volar integration on all TypeScript versions, under Settings > Languages & Frameworks > TypeScript > Vue. By default, Volar will be used for TypeScript versions 5.0 and higher.
